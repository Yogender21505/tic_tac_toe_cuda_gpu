# GPU-Powered Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game where two GPUs compete against each other using different strategies. One GPU employs a minimax algorithm for optimal play, while the other uses a heuristic-based approach. The goal is to showcase the use of GPUs in executing game strategies and to provide a visual demonstration of the game play.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates:
- GPU utilization for game strategy computation.
- Implementation of a minimax algorithm and heuristic-based strategy using CUDA.
- Visualization of game progression through PowerPoint slides or a video presentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- CUDA Toolkit (compatible with your GPU and CUDA version)
- PyCUDA
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpu-tic-tac-toe.git
   cd gpu-tic-tac-toe

### Install dependencies:
